# Origins learnPopGen tutorial
This set of jupyter notebooks (running R) is designed for undergraduate students in NNU's Origins class to learn about selection and drift. It uses the wonderful learnPopGen package (http://github.com/liamrevell/learnPopGen) by Liam Revel

It should be opened in a tool that can take advantage of the framework, such as google Colab.
